For this homework assignment, please read Chapter Chapter 9 (Intro to Streams and File I/O)'.

You may find it helpful to complete this before you work on lab04, and the deadline for lab04 has been extended to allow for this.

Or, you can work on lab04 first, and then if/when you find that you are stuck on how to do some part of the task, you can consult this chapter and complete the zyLabs
to help you get unstuck.

Either way, please complete all of the reading, participation exercise, challenge exercises, and zyLabs in this Chapter by the deadline indicated.  There is the usual one week grace period, but that should be used for emergencies, not treated as the deadline you "shoot for".
