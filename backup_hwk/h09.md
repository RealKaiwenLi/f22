For this homework assignment, please read Chapter 8, "A Gentle Introduction to Pointers".

At the moment, this short chapter (written by P. Conrad, not the zyBook authors) has no challenge, particiption or lab activities embedded in it.

But there are programs to run.  These programs are the some of the same ones shown in lecture on October 14 and October 19, and possibly other lectures as well.

You are encourage to run them, and to experiment with the code.
