There is an extra credit opportunity in this course as explained in [lecture on Tuesday 09/28/2021](https://ucsb-cs16.github.io/f21/lectures/lect02/).
* For more info, see the second slide in [this Slide Deck](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/17ma1G7gbReFFaQw6XDI8rD572XJIW6wJBzny9C6vvJ8/edit?usp=sharing)
* You can also watch the [class video from 09/28](https://gauchocast.hosted.panopto.com/Panopto/Pages/Viewer.aspx?id=74a7122d-82c1-427e-9903-adb2003c3941) starting at 4:00

# To earn the extra credit

By the due date ({{ page.due | date: "%a %m %d %Y at %H:%M"}}), please choose ONE of the following (only one is necessary to get the extra credit):
* Complete the start-of-course *survey* here: <https://forms.gle/4os1UtcgPQS4CcqEA> 
* *OR* (and don't do both) Complete the start-of-course *essay* here: <https://www.gradescope.com/courses/321530>

THEN, watch for another extra credit opportunity towards the end of the course.  That one will be similar, in that there will be two options:
* An end-of-course *survey* 
* *OR* (and don't do both) and end-of-course *essay*

If you have questions about the survey, please contact Richert Wang at richert@ucsb.edu
