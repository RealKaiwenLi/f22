For this homework assignment, please read  Chapter 10 (Intro to struct), which is a very short chapter, and Chapter 11 (Classes, Part 1)

There is only one participation activity in this Chapter 10; there are the usual set of participation, challenge, and just two zyLabs in Chapter 11.

Please complete all of these before the due date so that you are ready for the discussion in the lecture that follows.
